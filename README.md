# ASETNIOP Keymap for a Whitefox keyboard #

A weird 10-key keymap for a normal 60% keyboard. Mainly for reducing hand strain
while typing. It doesn't work very well yet.

## TODOs ##

1. DONE Add some way of accessing modifier keys and giving commands.
	* This currently uses a sticky command layer which allows accessing ctrl,
      shift, alt, etc. and then using these in command mode, one can issue key
      combinations of arbitrary length.
2. Add a shift sticky / one-shot key.
3. Add a ctrl sticky / one-shot key.
4. Add a super sticky / one-shot key.
5. Add an alt sticky / one-shot key.
6. Fix the sketchy parts of the code.
	* Made some progress.
7. DONE Add numbers.
8. Add punctuation.
