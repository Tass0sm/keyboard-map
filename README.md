# ASETNIOP Keymap for a Whitefox keyboard #

A weird 10-key keymap for a normal 60% keyboard. Mainly for reducing hand strain
while typing. It doesn't work very well yet.

## TODOs ##

1. Add a shift sticky key.
2. Add a ctrl sticky key.
3. Add a super sticky key.
4. Add an alt sticky key.
5. Fix the sketchy parts of the code.
